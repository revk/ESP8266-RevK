# ESP8266RevK
This is really just for my own use, but I know a couple of friends that will use it.

It contains the basic stuff I add to pretty much every ESP8266 project, which means controlling EEPROM stored settings, WiFi connection and reconenct, and connection to an MQTT server. It also includes OTA (initiated via MQTT). It is meant to be simple, but provide a consistent framework.

This is based on Arduino IDE.
